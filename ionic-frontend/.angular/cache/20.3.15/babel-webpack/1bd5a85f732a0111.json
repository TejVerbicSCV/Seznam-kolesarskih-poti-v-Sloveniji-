Stiffness, k: This is a measure of resistance applied a spring.\n * 2. Dampening, c: This value has the effect of reducing or preventing oscillation.\n *\n * Using these two values, we can calculate the Spring Force and the Dampening Force\n * to compute the total force applied to a spring.\n *\n * Spring Force: This force pulls a spring back into its equilibrium position.\n * Hooke's Law tells us that that spring force (FS) = kX.\n * k is the stiffness of a spring, and X is the displacement of the spring from its\n * equilibrium position. In this case, it is the amount by which the free end\n * of a spring was displaced (stretched/pushed) from its \"relaxed\" position.\n *\n * Dampening Force: This force slows down motion. Without it, a spring would oscillate forever.\n * The dampening force, FD, can be found via this formula: FD = -cv\n * where c the dampening value and v is velocity.\n *\n * Therefore, the resulting force that is exerted on the block is:\n * F = FS + FD = -kX - cv\n *\n * Newton's 2nd Law tells us that F = ma:\n * ma = -kX - cv.\n *\n * For Ionic's purposes, we can assume that m = 1:\n * a = -kX - cv\n *\n * Imagine a block attached to the end of a spring. At equilibrium\n * the block is at position x = 1.\n * Pressing on the block moves it to position x = 0;\n * So, to calculate the displacement, we need to take the\n * current position and subtract the previous position from it.\n * X = x - x0 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n *\n * For Ionic's purposes, we are only pushing on the spring modal\n * so we have a max position of 1.\n * As a result, we can expand displacement to this formula:\n * X = x - 1\n *\n * a = -k(x - 1) - cv\n *\n * We can represent the motion of something as a function of time: f(t) = x.\n * The derivative of position gives us the velocity: f'(t)\n * The derivative of the velocity gives us the acceleration: f''(t)\n *\n * We can substitute the formula above with these values:\n *\n * f\"(t) = -k * (f(t) - 1) - c * f'(t)\n *\n * This is called a differential equation.\n *\n * We know that at t = 0, we are at x = 0 because the modal does not move: f(0) = 0\n * This means our velocity is also zero: f'(0) = 0.\n *\n * We can cheat a bit and plug the formula into Wolfram Alpha.\n * However, we need to pick stiffness and dampening values:\n * k = 0.57\n * c = 15\n *\n * I picked these as they are fairly close to native iOS's spring effect\n * with the modal.\n *\n * What we plug in is this: f(0) = 0; f'(0) = 0; f''(t) = -0.57(f(t) - 1) - 15f'(t)\n *\n * The result is a formula that lets us calculate the acceleration\n * for a given time t.\n * Note: This is the approximate form of the solution.

Stiffness, k: This is a measure of resistance applied a spring.\n * 2. Dampening, c: This value has the effect of reducing or preventing oscillation.\n *\n * Using these two values, we can calculate the Spring Force and the Dampening Force\n * to compute the total force applied to a spring.\n *\n * Spring Force: This force pulls a spring back into its equilibrium position.\n * Hooke's Law tells us that that spring force (FS) = kX.\n * k is the stiffness of a spring, and X is the displacement of the spring from its\n * equilibrium position. In this case, it is the amount by which the free end\n * of a spring was displaced (stretched/pushed) from its \"relaxed\" position.\n *\n * Dampening Force: This force slows down motion. Without it, a spring would oscillate forever.\n * The dampening force, FD, can be found via this formula: FD = -cv\n * where c the dampening value and v is velocity.\n *\n * Therefore, the resulting force that is exerted on the block is:\n * F = FS + FD = -kX - cv\n *\n * Newton's 2nd Law tells us that F = ma:\n * ma = -kX - cv.\n *\n * For Ionic's purposes, we can assume that m = 1:\n * a = -kX - cv\n *\n * Imagine a block attached to the end of a spring. At equilibrium\n * the block is at position x = 1.\n * Pressing on the block moves it to position x = 0;\n * So, to calculate the displacement, we need to take the\n * current position and subtract the previous position from it.\n * X = x - x0 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n *\n * For Ionic's purposes, we are only pushing on the spring modal\n * so we have a max position of 1.\n * As a result, we can expand displacement to this formula:\n * X = x - 1\n *\n * a = -k(x - 1) - cv\n *\n * We can represent the motion of something as a function of time: f(t) = x.\n * The derivative of position gives us the velocity: f'(t)\n * The derivative of the velocity gives us the acceleration: f''(t)\n *\n * We can substitute the formula above with these values:\n *\n * f\"(t) = -k * (f(t) - 1) - c * f'(t)\n *\n * This is called a differential equation.\n *\n * We know that at t = 0, we are at x = 0 because the modal does not move: f(0) = 0\n * This means our velocity is also zero: f'(0) = 0.\n *\n * We can cheat a bit and plug the formula into Wolfram Alpha.\n * However, we need to pick stiffness and dampening values:\n * k = 0.57\n * c = 15\n *\n * I picked these as they are fairly close to native iOS's spring effect\n * with the modal.\n *\n * What we plug in is this: f(0) = 0; f'(0) = 0; f''(t) = -0.57(f(t) - 1) - 15f'(t)\n *\n * The result is a formula that lets us calculate the acceleration\n * for a given time t.\n * Note: This is the approximate form of the solution.
